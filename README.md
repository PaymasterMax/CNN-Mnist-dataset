# CNN-Mnist-dataset

# ## 1. The dataset used here is the mnist dataset found in tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
# ## 2. This dataset contains images of handwritten digits 
# ## 3. In this model, Convulated neural network and maxpooling has been employed to perform picking out the important features of the dataset
# ## 4. The model (CNN models) are stacked om top of the models before the hidden layers added later on it.
# ## 5. The dataset is preprocessed by default, all we have to do is simply reshaping the images to the 4 dimensions expected by the convulation models. then feed it to the hidden layers of the network.
# ## 6. The CNN networks are not surfficient to do the image classification by their own, they depend on the hidden dense network.
